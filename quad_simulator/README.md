# Quad Simulator

## Overview

This package simulates a quadruped robot in Gazebo.  It is heavily based on the [kodlab_gazebo](https://github.com/KodlabPenn/kodlab_gazebo) package.
The included Spirit40 robot model was originally created by Ghost Robotics.  Spirit40 can be simulated either with realistic motor rotor inertia or with rotor inertia neglected.

Important fiction parameters for the foot contact with the ground can be found in the URDF files. xacro file support is a work in progress.

### License

The Quad Simulator package has been tested under [ROS] Noetic 20.04.
This is research code, expect that it changes often and any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.

## Usage

Launch the Gazebo simulation with

	roslaunch quad_utils quad_gazebo.launch

## Config files

* **spirit_control.yaml** sets joint controllers and contact publishing rates

## Nodes

### contact_state_publisher

Publishes the Ground Reaction Forces from the feet.

#### Subscribed Topics

* **`/gazebo/toe[0-3]_contact_state`** ([gazebo_msgs/ContactsState])

        These four topics report information about contact at each of the four feet.

#### Published Topics

* **`/state/grfs`** ([quad_msgs/GRFArray])

        Ground reaction forces at all four feet.

#### Parameters

* **`update_rate`** (double, default: 500)

        The update rate of the publisher (in Hz)
